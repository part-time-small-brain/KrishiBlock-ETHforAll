# 🧑‍🌾 **KrishiBlock**

Krishiblock brings the advantages of blockchain to one of the most centralized existing solutions ~ land registry.

India is the second-largest population and the seventh-largest territory in the world. India is an agriculture-based economy, and agriculture land record keeping is a mammoth transnational activity with mostly manual and non-digital processes. There are many challenges related to agricultural land transactions such as digitization of records and keeping the agricultural-land ledger immutable and secure. KrishiBlock aims to solve these challenges in an efficient manner this will help handle the increasing agricultural-land litigation cases, reducing corruption, and improving the quality of farm owner’s life.

Any user can sign into KrishiBlock and register their lands, these users and their lands are then to be verified by the Lekhpal for them to be recognized as official records. Lekhpal can only be added by the Tehsildar, the Tehsildar plays a significant role as it is the only role that can approve the transfer of ownership of lands from one user to another. The contract deployer is the SDM, who is at the top of the chain and is required while adding or removing tehsildar, the SDM can be transferred if need be.

```
KrishiBlock incorporates the hierarchy that the government already has in place, it goes like this:  
SDM (Sub-divisional magistrate) -> Tehsildar (Revenue Officer) -> Lekhpal (Village accountant) -> User
```
