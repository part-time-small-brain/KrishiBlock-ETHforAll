# KrishiBlock

Docs under development
<!-- India is second largest population and seventh largest territory in the world. India is an agriculture-based economy, and agriculture land record keeping is a mammoth transactional activity with mostly manual and non-digital processes. There are many challenges related to Krishi-land transactions such as digitalization of records, simplifying the sale-purchase process, keeping the Krishi-land ledger immutable and secure. The efficient solution of these challenges will help handling the increasing Krishi-land litigation cases, reducing the corruption, improving the quality of farm ownerâ€™s life.

KrishiBlock has a user-friendly interface for the farmers to register their land. The land record is stored on the blockchain and is immutable. The land records are availible to different kinds of government authorities such as SDM, Tehsildar and Lekhpal. All of these roles can be assigned and they all carry out different tasks in their hierarchical order. The government authorities can verify the land record and can also update the land record. -->
